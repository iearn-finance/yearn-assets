# Yearn Naming Standard

## yVaults

- Acceptable alternative names include Yearn Vaults, or informally referring to the product as vaults.
- When referring to a specific yVault, the preferred name is generally `token name + yVault`; this matches the `name` field on the token contract. However, it is also acceptable to use `yvToken + Vault` or `yvToken`; the latter matches `symbol` in the contract.
  - **Examples:** `DAI yVault`, `yvDAI Vault`, or simply `yvDAI`
- For each yVault, name and symbol conventions are as follows:
  - Name: `${token.symbol()} or override yVault`
  - Symbol: `yv${token.symbol()} or override`
- A `version` field is included in the token contract to correspond to the major yVault release version.
- The predominant use case for name and symbol override is for LP tokens.
  - Curve
    - Name: `Curve + pool + Pool yVault`
      - **Examples:** `Curve sBTC Pool yVault`, `Curve 3pool yVault`, `Curve Y Pool yVault`
      - In this case, `pool` is taken directly from Curve.fi's UI, and we can adjust for capitalization as needed. In the case of the `3pool`, the redundant "Pool" is removed.
    - Symbol: `yvCurve-pool`
      - **Examples:** `yvCurve-sBTC`, `yvCurve-3pool`, `yvCurve-Y`
    - Note: In this methodology, `yvCurve-Y` replaces the previously used `yUSD`. In the future, `yUSD` will be used to refer to the Meta Vault token.
  - Uniswap
    - Name: `Uniswap + v${self.version()} + TOKEN-TOKEN + Pool yVault`
      - **Examples:** `Uniswap v2 USDT-WETH Pool yVault`, `Uniswap v2 WBTC-WETH Pool yVault`
    - Symbol: `yvUni-TOKEN-TOKEN`
      - **Examples:** `yvUni-USDT-WETH`, `yvUni-WBTC-WETH`
    - Note: Version was included for Uniswap LP tokens to help limit confusion between UNI-v2 LP tokens and upcoming UNI-v3 LP tokens.
  - Balancer
    - Name: `Balancer + TOKEN-TOKEN + Pool yVault`
      - **Examples:** `Balancer USDT-WETH Pool yVault`, `Balancer WBTC-WETH Pool yVault`
    - Symbol: `yvBal-TOKEN-TOKEN`
      - **Examples:** `yvBal-USDT-WETH`, `yvBal-WBTC-WETH`
    - Note: Since Balancer allows more than two tokens per pool, append as many `TOKEN` as needed for the pool in question.

## yCover

- Tokens for yCover are named following a similar methodology as yVaults, with the only difference being the two letter prefix.
  - **Examples:** `ycUSDC`, `ycUni-USDT-WETH`

## yEarn

- These are Yearn's original yield-aware tokens, whose v2 and v3 contracts can be found [here](https://docs.yearn.finance/developers/deployed-contracts-registry#v2-yield-tokens).
- These products should be referred to as yEarn Tokens, `underlying token name + Earn`, or `y{token.symbol()}v${self.version()}`
  - **Examples:** `yDAIv2`, `yDAI Earn`, `yBUSDv3`, `yBUSD Earn`

## Test Products

- For deployed contracts that have not reached their final production version, a simple modification is included to designate these on the contract level as being test products.
  - Name: `${token.symbol()} or override + Test + Product`
  - Symbol: `yt${token.symbol()} or override`
  - **Examples:** `DAI Test yVault`, `ytDAI`
- Additionally, the v2 yVault contracts have upgradeable `name` and `symbol` fields. This means that should a test contract perform well, these fields can be updated to reflect that it is no longer a test contract, removing the need to deploy new contracts.

## Future Products

- Future products can follow a simple naming convention: `y + product`, where the product and any potential token names follow similar guidelines as above with yVaults. These can then be further modified as needed based on the product(s).
  - **Examples:** `ySwap`, `yBorrow`, `yTrade`
