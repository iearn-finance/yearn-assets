SVG assets don't lose quality when scaled, but they might not be compatible with some platforms.

PNG assets lose quality when scaled but they have wide compatibility accross all platforms.

## Colors

We have 3 colors in total: 1 primary color and 2 secondary colors.

We mostly use primary one for accents and secondary ones for gradients.

- Secondary Blue:
  - Dark blue: `#095EB5`
  - Light blue: `#0077FC`

## Fonts

We have 2 fonts, one primary, one secondary.

We use the primary font for almost everything, like titles, paragraphs and logo.

And we use the secondary font for numerals/metrics and any text block that requires same width lines.
